Description
    Calculates approximately the asymmetric projection depth of points w.r.t. a multivariate data set.

Arguments
    x 			
            Matrix of objects (numerical vector as one object) whose depth is to be calculated;
            each row contains a d-variate point. Should have the same dimension as data.

    data 			
            Matrix of data where each row contains a d-variate point, w.r.t. which the depth
            is to be calculated.

    solver
        The type of solver used to approximate the depth.
        {``'simplegrid'``, ``'refinedgrid'``, ``'simplerandom'``, ``'refinedrandom'``, ``'coordinatedescent'``, ``'randomsimplices'``, ``'neldermead'``, ``'simulatedannealing'``}

    NRandom
        The total number of iterations to compute the depth. Some solvers are converging
        faster so they are run several time to achieve ``NRandom`` iterations.
                   
    option
        |        If ``option=1``, only approximated depths are returned.
        |        If ``option=2``, best directions to approximate depths are also returned.
        |        If ``option=3``, depths calculated at every iteration are also returned.
        |        If ``option=4``, random directions used to project depths are also returned with indices of converging for the solver selected.

    n_refinements
        Set the maximum of iteration for computing the depth of one point.
        For ``solver='refinedrandom'`` or ``'refinedgrid'``.
                      
    sphcap_shrink
        It's the shrinking of the spherical cap. For ``solver='refinedrandom'`` or ``'refinedgrid'``.

    alpha_Dirichlet
        It's the parameter of the Dirichlet distribution. For ``solver='randomsimplices'``.

    cooling_factor
        It's the cooling factor. For ``solver='simulatedannealing'``.

    cap_size
        It's the size of the spherical cap. For ``solver='simulatedannealing'`` or ``'neldermead'``.

    start
        {'mean', 'random'}.
        For ``solver='simulatedannealing'`` or ``'neldermead'``, it's the method used to compute the first depth.
                      
    space
        {``'sphere'``, ``'euclidean'``}.
        For ``solver='coordinatedescent'`` or ``'neldermead'``, it's the type of spacecin which the solver is running.
                      
    line_solver
        {``'uniform'``, ``'goldensection'``}.
        For ``solver='coordinatedescent'``, it's the line searh strategy used by this solver.
                      
    bound_gc
        For ``solver='neldermead'``, it's ``True`` if the search is limited to the closed hemisphere.
